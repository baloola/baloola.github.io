</div>
<p>On the one side there is a provider of Earth Observation (EO) data. The
provider has a possibly huge, in terms of storage size, archive of EO data and
wants to provide this data to users. Of course the data provision has to follow
certain constraints and requirements like technical, managerial, or security
frame conditions but in general the provider wants to reach as many users as
possible with minimal efforts.</p>
<p>On the other side there is a user of EO data. The user has the need of certain
EO data as input to some processing which varies from simple viewing to complex
data analysis and generation of derived data. The user wants to obtain the
needed EO data as easily as possible which includes finding the right data from
the right provider at the right time at the right location and retrieving it in
the right representation e.g. format.</p>
<p>Already from this simple constellation the need for standardized interfaces is
evident. Thus EOxServer implements the open publicly available interface
standards defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). In particular
EOxServer contains an implementation of the Web Coverage Service (WCS)
including its Earth Observation Application Profile (EO-WCS) and the Web Map
Service (WMS) again including its EO extension (EO-WMS).</p>
<p>These interface standards have been chosen to support the new paradigm of
“zooming to the data”. This means looking at previews of the data rather than
searching in a catalogue in order to find the right data. WMS together with its
EO extension is used for the previews whereas WCS with its EO extensions is
used to download the previously viewed data and metadata. Of course a provider
is free to operate a catalogue in parallel including references to the EO-WMS
and EO-WCS.</p>
<p>The EOxServer software stack is a collection of Open Source Software designed
to enhance a wide range of legacy systems of EO data archives with controlled
Web-based access (“online data access”) with minimal efforts for the provider.
The user not only significantly benefits from the provider’s enhanced online
data access but also from the client functionalities included in the EOxServer
software stack.</p>
<p>In particular the EOxServer software stack provides the following features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>easy to install</li>
<li>simple yet powerful web interface for data registration for the provider</li>
<li>standardized way to access geographic data i.e. via EO-WMS and EO-WCS</li>
<li>download of subsets of data</li>
<li>on the fly re-projection, re-sampling, and format conversion</li>
<li>visual preview of data</li>
<li>integrated usage of EO-WMS and EO-WCS to view and download the same data</li>
<li>intelligent automated handling of EO collections and mosaics</li>
<li>homogeneous way to access different data, metadata, and packaging formats</li>
<li>homogeneous access to different storage systems i.e. file system, ftp, and
rasdaman</li>
</ul>
<p>These features result in the general benefit for the provider to be more
attractive to the user.</p>
<p>The following sub-sections provide details from the provider and user point of
view highlighting the possible usage of the EOxServer software stack.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-general-provider-view">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#table-of-contents">The General <em>Provider</em> View</a><a class="headerlink" href="#the-general-provider-view" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The provider operates an archive of EO data with different ways of actually
accessing the data. For simplicity let’s assume the data archived in this
legacy system can be accessed in two ways. First there is the local access
directly to the file system via operating system capabilities. Second there is
an online access by exposing certain directories via FTP.</p>
<p>The EOxServer software stack acts as a middle-ware layer in front of the legacy
archive system that expands the offered functionality and thus widens the
potential user or customer base. The additional functionality compared to plain
FTP access includes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>interoperable online access via a standard interface defined by an accepted
international industry consortium</li>
<li>domain and range sub-setting of coverages allowing to download only the
needed parts of a coverage and thus saving bandwidth</li>
<li>spatial-temporal search within the offered coverages</li>
<li>on-the-fly mosaicking</li>
<li>on-the-fly re-projection</li>
<li>delivery in multiple encoding formats i.e. on-the-fly format conversion</li>
<li>on-the-fly scaling and re-sampling</li>
<li>preview via EO-WMS</li>
<li>embedding of metadata (EO-O&amp;M) adjusted to the actual delivered coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure: “<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-global-use-case-provider"><span class="std std-ref">Provider View</span></a>” provides an overview of the
provider environment showing the provider’s legacy system and the extending
EOxServer software stack.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id3">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><em>Provider View</em></span></p>
</div>
<p>The recommended way for the installation of the EOxServer software stack is to
use a host which has direct read access to the data via the file system using
operating system capabilities. If this file system is physically located on the
same hardware host or if it is mounted from some remote storage e.g. via NFS or
Samba doesn’t matter in terms of functionality. However, in terms of
performance the actual configuration has some impact as big data might have to
be transferred over the network with different bandwidths.</p>
<p>The other option is to use the read access via FTP which is a practical
configuration in terms of functionality. However, in terms of performance this
isn’t the recommended configuration because of  the need to always transfer
whole files even if only a subset is needed. Various caching strategies will
significantly improve this configuration, though.</p>
<p>After the installation of all software components needed for the EOxServer
software stack there are two main activities left for the provider:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Configure the environment (e.g. register service endpoint(s) in a web server)
and EOxServer (e.g. enable or disable components like services)</li>
<li>Register data</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure: “<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-global-use-case-provider-activities"><span class="std std-ref">Activities to Enhance the Provider’s Environment</span></a>” shows these activities
needed to enhance the provider’s environment with online data access to the EO
data archive legacy system.</p>

<div class="section" id="environment-software-configuration">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#table-of-contents">Environment &amp; Software Configuration</a><a class="headerlink" href="#environment-software-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The EOxServer software stack consists of the EOxServer, the Identity
Management, and the Applications Interface software components.</p>
<p>The Identity Management layer is an optional layer on top of EOxServer. Thus
and because its configuration is extensively discussed in section
<a class="reference internal" href="idm/index.html#identity-management-system"><span class="std std-ref">Identity Management System</span></a> we skip it here.</p>
<p>The Applications Interface software components are discussed in detail in
section <a class="reference internal" href="#the-general-user-view">The General User View</a> below.</p>
<p>As EOxServer is based on Python, MapServer, GDAL/OGR, and Django these software
components need to be installed first. The base configuration of EOxServer
consists of the generation of an EOxServer instance and registering it in a web
server.</p>
<p>The EOxServer instance generation includes the configuration of various
parameters like database name, type, and connection info, instance id, paths to
logfiles, temporary directories, etc. as well as the initialization of its
database. There are two options for the database management system (DBMS). The
first is SQLite together with SpatialLite which is a single file DBMS and thus
best suited for testing purposes. The second is PostgreSQL together with
PostGIS which is a full fledged DBMS with numerous management functionalities
and thus best suited for operational environments.</p>
<p>The database itself holds the configuration of components and resources (e.g.
is WCS 1.0.0 enabled) as well as the coverage metadata ingested during
registration (see section <a class="reference internal" href="#data-registration">Data Registration</a>).</p>
<p>EOxServer can be operated with any web server that supports the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/deployment/">Python WSGI
standards</a>. For
testing and implementation purposes the Django framework directly provides a
simple web server. However, in operational environments the recommended
deployment of EOxServer is to use the well-known <a class="reference external" href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache web server</a> together with <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/">mod_wsgi</a>. In most cases it will be the easiest,
fastest, and most stable deployment choice.</p>
<p>At this point the provider’s administrator or operator can actually run the
software stack and configure the remainder via EOxServer’s admin app. This app
is accessed via a standard web browser and, when using Django’s internal web
server, available at the URL: “<a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8000/admin">http://localhost:8000/admin</a>”. Use the user
credentials that have been set in the database initialization step.</p>
<p>Figure: “<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-admin-app-start"><span class="std std-ref">Admin app - Start</span></a>” shows the admin app after successful
login. On the left side the four modules “Auth”, “Backends”, “Core”, and
“Coverages” are shown. “Auth” is the internal Django user management module
which is at the moment only used for the admin app itself. “Backends” and
“Coverages” are the modules for data registration which is described in section
<a class="reference internal" href="#data-registration">Data Registration</a> below.</p>
<p>The “Core” module is used to enable or disable EOxServer components like
services. The provider can decide which services and even which versions of
which services EOxServer shall expose. A possible configuration is to expose
WCS 2.0 and WMS 1.3.0 which are the latest versions but not any older version.
In the default database initialization all services are enabled.</p>

<div class="section" id="data-registration">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#table-of-contents">Data Registration</a><a class="headerlink" href="#data-registration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The data registration is done via the functionalities provided by the
“Backends” and “Coverages” modules of the admin app. Figure:
“<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-admin-app-start"><span class="std std-ref">Admin app - Start</span></a>” shows for which data types, or models in Django
terminology, instances can be added or changed in these modules. These data
types correspond to tables in the database. Only a subset of the full data
model (see Figure: “<a class="reference internal" href="../developers/data_model.html#fig-model-coverages"><span class="std std-ref">EOxServer Data Model for Coverage Resources</span></a>)” is shown in the admin app
because some are filled automatically upon saving and some are included in the
available ones like TileIndex in Stitched Mosaics.</p>
<p>The Dataset Series provides a convenient way to register a complete dataset
series or collection at once. Figure:
“<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-admin-app-change-dataset-series"><span class="std std-ref">Admin app - Add/Change Dataset Series</span></a>” shows the admin app when changing
a Dataset Series instance. The operator has to provide an “EO ID” and an “EO
Metadata Entry”. All other parameters are optional as can be seen by the usage
of normal instead of bold face text. However, in order to actually register
coverages either one or multiple “Data sources”, consisting of a “Location”
e.g. a data directory and a “Search pattern”, have to be added. Alternatively,
the administrator can decide to register single coverages and link them to the
Dataset Series via the “Advanced coverage handling” module (see Figure:
“<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-admin-app-change-dataset-series-advanced"><span class="std std-ref">Admin app - Add/Change Dataset Series Advanced</span></a>”).</p>

<p>Figure: “<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-admin-app-change-eo-metadata"><span class="std std-ref">Admin app - Add/Change EO Meatadata</span></a>” shows the screen for adding
or changing an EO metadata entry. The operator has to provide the “Begin of
acquisition”, “End of acquisition”, and “Footprint” of the overall Dataset
Series in the same way as for any EO Coverage. Calendar, clock, and map widgets
are provided to ease the provision of these parameters. Optionally a full EO
O&amp;M metadata record can be supplied.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><em>Admin app - Add/Change EO Meatadata</em></span></p>
</div>
<p>Saving a Dataset Series triggers a synchronization process. This process scans
the Locations, e.g. directories and included sub-directories, of all configured
Data Sources for files that follow the configured search pattern e.g. “*.tif”.
All files found are evaluated using GDAL and for any valid and readable raster
file a Dataset instance is generated in the database holding all metadata
including EO metadata for the raster file. Of course the raster file itself
remains unchanged in the file system.</p>
<p>Let’s look in more detail at the synchronization process and assume a plain
GeoTIFF file with name “demo.tif” was found. The synchronization process
extracts the necessary geographic metadata i.e. the domainSet or extent
consisting of CRS, size, and bounding box directly from the GeoTIFF file. Where
does the metadata come from? In order to retrieve the EO metadata at the moment
the process looks for a file called “demo.xml” accompanying the GeoTIFF file.
In future this may be expanded to automatically retrieve the metadata from
catalogues like the ones the EOLI-SA connects to but for the moment the files
have to be generated before the registration. The content of this file can
either be a complete EO-O&amp;M metadata record or a simple native metadata record
containing only the mandatory parameters which are: “EOID”, “Begin of
acquisition”, “End of acquisition”, and “Footprint”. If no “demo.xml” is found
the process uses default values which are: file name without extension, current
date and time, and full bounding box of raster file. Of course, the
synchronization process can be re-run at any time e.g. from a daily, hourly,
etc. cronjob.</p>
<p>This configuration is sufficient to bring online a complete EO data archive
accessible via the file system.</p>
<p>A comparable synchronization process is available for FTP and rasdaman
back-ends as well as for Stitched Mosaics. However, mostly these processes
require more complex synchronization steps. For example, via the FTP back-end
it is better to not inspect the raster files itself which would mean to

<p>The user needs certain EO data as input to some processing. This processing
ranges from simply viewing certain parameters of EO data to complex data
analysis and generation of derived data. The user has an environment with the
software installed needed for the processing. For simplicity let’s assume the
user has two different software tools installed to process the data. First
there is a standard web browser which manages the HTTP protocol and is capable
of viewing HTML web pages. Second there is a GIS software which shall be QGis
in our example.</p>
<p>Figure: “<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-global-use-case-user"><span class="std std-ref">User View</span></a>” shows the user environment and its
installed software.</p>

<p>First of all the user needs to find an EO data provider who has data that fit
the user’s purpose and who offers the data via a mechanism the user can handle.
Luckily the user happens to know a provider who is running the EOxServer
software stack on an EO data archive holding the required data. Thus the user
can decide between several ways how to retrieve the data. Some involve client
side components of the EOxServer software stack but because of the strict
adherence to open standards various other ways are possible in parallel.
However, we’ll focus below on two ways involving EOxServer software components.</p>
<div class="section" id="web-browser">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#table-of-contents">Web Browser</a><a class="headerlink" href="#web-browser" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the first case the provider offers a dedicated app using EOxServer’s Web
API. This app consists of HTML and Javascript files and is served via a web
server from the provider’s environment. In our case the app provides access to
one dataset series holding some MERIS scenes over Europe.</p>
<p>Figure: “<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-client-openlayers"><span class="std std-ref">Browser app featuring EOxServer’s Web API</span></a>” shows a screen shot of this app. The app
implements the paradigm of “zooming to the data” i.e. the user directly looks
at previews of the data served via EO-WMS rather than having to search in a
catalogue first. After zooming to and therewith setting the Area of Interest
(AoI) and setting the Time of Interest (ToI) the user following the download
button is presented with the metadata of the included datasets retrieved from
the offered EO-WCS. The metadata includes grid, bands, CRS, nil values, etc. of
the datasets but also formats, CRSs, and interpolation methods the dataset can
be retrieved in. Based on this information the user decides which datasets to
download and specifies parameters of the download like spatial sub-setting,
band sub-setting, CRS, size/resolution, interpolation method, format, and
format specific parameters like compression. The app guides the user to specify
all these parameters and downloads only the really needed data to the user’s
environment. The EO-WCS protocol is used by the app transparently to the user
i.e. most of the complexity of the EO-WCS protocol is hidden.</p>
<p>This app shows the benefit of the integrated usage of EO-WMS and EO-WCS for the
online data access to the EO data archive.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#table-of-contents">GIS Tool</a><a class="headerlink" href="#gis-tool" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Note, that the Python Client API is not yet implemented and only available as
concept.</p>
<p>In the second case the user wants to use the full-fledged GIS software tool
QGis and thus decides to use the handy EO-WCS plug-in provided by the provider.
This plug-in makes extensive use of EOxServer’s Python Client API.</p>
<p>Figure: “<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-client-qgis"><span class="std std-ref">QGis EO-WCS Plug-in featuring EOxServer’s Python Client API</span></a>” shows a screen shot how the usage of the
EO-WCS plug-in for QGis might look like. The user first has to connect to the
provider’s EO-WCS endpoint. Once connected the plug-in retrieves the metadata
about the available dataset series and shows them as a list to the user
together with the tools to specify AoI and ToI. Metadata of datasets and
stitched mosaics might also be retrieved in this step if the provider
configured some to be directly visible in the capabilities of the EO-WCS.</p>
<p>The selected dataset series are transparently searched within the set
spatio-temporal bounding box and available datasets and stitched mosaics
presented to the user. After exploring and setting the download parameters
like in the first case the EO-WCS plug-in downloads again only the required
data sub-sets. In addition to the previous case the EO-WCS plug-in applies
various strategies to limit the data download. For example if a dataset is
added to the current list of layers only the currently viewed area needs to be
filled with data at the resolution of the screen. In addition the data can be
sub-setted to one or three bands that are shown i.e. there’s no need to
download numerous float32 bands just to preview the data.</p>
<p>With using the EOxServer software stack on the provider side the plug-in
includes the possibility to exploit the integrated usage of EO-WMS and EO-WCS.
This exploitation includes the displaying of previews in the two steps
described above. Another feature is, that the possibly nicer looking images are
retrieved from the performance optimized EO-WMS to fill the current view.</p>
<p>Once the user starts some sophisticated processing the plug-in retrieves the
required sub-sets of the original data. Again strategies to limit the data
download are applied.</p>
